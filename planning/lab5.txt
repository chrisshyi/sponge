Data Structures:

1. Mapping of IPv4 addresses to EthernetAddress objects, need to also keep track of the age of each mapping

std::unordered_map<uint32_t, std::pair<EthernetAddress, size_t>>

2. Queue of IP datagrams waiting for an ARP response

Create a mapping of IP -> queue of IP datagrams

When an ARP response is received, access the map and send all IP datagrams in the queue
